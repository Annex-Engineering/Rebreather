## Rebreather

## What is it?
This is a tiny air recirculation filter that can fit inside your 3d printers chamber. It utilizes activated carbon pellets to capture VOC particles. Its heavily inspired by the work of 0ndsk4 and the Nevermore Micro. Its improvements lie in the dual blower design thats more powerfull and compact. Theres no glue needed anymore to mount the blower. The blowers are OTS components with proper PWM and Tach support. They also have polarity and locked rotor protection. The cartridge has been extended to increase the absorbtion capacity. With a printed mesh its hard to get good layerstacking so this has been replaced with mesh material like you would find in a computer case. The filter is still in beta and feedback is welcome.

## Hardware needed:
- 8x M2x4 
- 9x M3x8 (self tapping)
- 8x 6x3mm magnet
- 2x Delta KFB04512HHAF0C
- 30x3cm computer mesh*
- 1x M3x5x4 heatinsert

The total price excluding carbon pellets is around 25 euro. A sourcing guide can be found on Discord.
*Cutting along the 'grain' results in a straight cut. A sample strip stl is included to help.

## Maintenance
It is recommended to replace the contents of the cartridge every 100H or 2 months.

## Future plans
Once the Delta KFB0612HAFDB comes back in stock it can be a good substitute candidate thats even more powerfull. An integrated dustfilter can also be explored.
