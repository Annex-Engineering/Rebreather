## Rebreather XL


## What is it?
Rebreather XL is a Delta KFB0612HAFDB version of the standard Rebreather. Size of the cartridge is slightly larger, as proportionally all sizes are bigger. All bolt holes and sizes (except for the rear hole for attaching to the 130mm mount) are identical.

Also, magnet holes have been aligned.
